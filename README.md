# Developer Portfolio Website with Theme Customization

Welcome to my developer portfolio website built using React! This site is designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experience, providing an interactive platform for potential clients or employers to explore my work. One of the standout features of this portfolio is the **complete theme customization functionality**, allowing users to easily change the background and primary colors of the website to match their personal style or brand.

What makes this portfolio even more user-friendly is that **theme settings are saved in the browser's local storage**. This means that even if you close your browser or refresh the page, your last theme preferences will be automatically retained.

## Key Features:
- **Theme Customization**: Easily switch between different color schemes to personalize the website.
- **Animate-on-scroll**: Interactive animations that trigger as you scroll through the content, enhancing the user experience.
- **Convenient Contact Options**: Direct links to WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and email, making it simple for users to contact me.
- **Auto-scroll Carousel**: A smooth, auto-scrolling carousel to showcase client testimonials.
- **Filterable Portfolio**: Easily browse through my portfolio projects using the built-in filter system.
- **FAQs Toggle**: An interactive toggle for Frequently Asked Questions, keeping the page clean and organized.
- **Floating Navbar**: A responsive, elegant floating navbar that works seamlessly across tablet and mobile devices.

## Technologies & Tools:
- **React**: Frontend development using React.js for a dynamic user interface.
- **React Hooks**: Utilized `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useReducer`, `useContext`, and custom hooks to manage state and side-effects in a clean and efficient manner.
- **React Portal**: Used React Portals to render certain components outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
- **Swiper JS**: Integrated Swiper JS for creating a smooth and interactive carousel effect.
